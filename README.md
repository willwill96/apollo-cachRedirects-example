# apollo-cachRedirects-example
This is the code used for the youtube tutorial [Apollo GraphQL: Improving Network Performance with cacheRedirects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRtD7WPsW-0)


# How to use
To start up graphql server, run
`yarn install && yarn start`

This will start the graphql server on port 4000 - you can view the Graphql playground at localhost:4000/graphql

To start up the webapp, run
`yarn install && yarn dev`
or (for a nextjs production build)
`yarn install && yarn build && yarn start`

This will start the webapp on port 3000 - you can view the index page at localhost:3000
